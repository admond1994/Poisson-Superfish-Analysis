# Synopsis

Superconducting elliptical Radio Frequency (RF) cavities are proposed to
accelerate proton beams in Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh). In this project,
I focus on using Poisson Superfish for 2D simulation to optimize the
geometrical parameters - dome and iris ratios of single-cell superconducting
elliptical RF cavities to generate specified optimum figures of merit -
resonant frequency, peak electric and magnetic fields on the cavity surface,
and quality factor. Comparative studies between Poisson Superfish (2D
simulation) and CST Microwave Studio (3D simulation) have verified our
optimization results in which the optimum dome and iris ratios are 0.74
and 0.51 respectively. The analysis demonstrates the capabilites of Poisson
Superfish in tuning and optimizing geometrical parameters for elliptical RF
cavities by achieving optimum figures of merit.
